## Period 2 Share [ Do not distribute/share. ]

Heyo! Jeebus here, you have stumbled upon the home page of the provider repository!
I usually use this repository to share files and shorten links.
Shortened Links usually go to Google Drive which can only be accessible by people from the district (Students/Teachers/TAs).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Google Drive Shortened Links

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/UnicodeBerry/period2-dir/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
